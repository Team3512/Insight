/* This class creates a child window that receives MJPEG images and displays
 * them from a separate thread.
 *
 * To start using this class, just create an instance of it; everything else
 * is handled in a spawned thread
 *
 * Call startStream() to start the MJPEG stream or stopStream() to stop it
 * manually. This won't open or close the window.
 *
 * startStream() and stopStream() are called automatically in the constructor
 * and destructor respectively, but they can be called manually if desired.
 *
 * Change the button ID from IDC_STREAM_BUTTON to another ID if you want to
 * process more than one stream at once in WndProc
 *
 * Make sure every instance you create of this class is destroyed before its
 * respective parent window. If not, the application will crash.
